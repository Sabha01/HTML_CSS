    <p class="a2">In the ancient days, football was not made of leather. In some places, people blew up pigs’ bladders to make footballs. In the Mesoamerican culture, football was played with a rock. It denoted the Sun God. The unfortunate thing was, the losing team’s captain was sacrificed to God. This element of violence and barbarism in football continued even when the early signs of modern football started emerging in England.  As the world moved in the 19th century, this game got separated into two forms. In one form, there was the provision to carry the ball with hands and in the other, handling the ball was forbidden except for the goalkeeper. During this time, the rules of the game were set and the violence associated with it was largely reduced. </p>

            <h3>Why Do So Many People Love Playing Football?</h3>
            <p>Football, unlike cricket, has no moment of dullness. There is excitement till the last second of the 90-minute game. The joy of passing the ball from the jungle of opponents, and the joy of smashing the ball to the goal is priceless. As the player is moving forward with the ball, there is always that danger of getting the ball snatched away by the opponent. Then there are expert players like Messi or Beckham who magically make the ball take a curve-turn all the while in the air.  </p>
